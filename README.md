The Generative Intelligence Lab is dedicated to the research-driven development of Generative Intelligence Systems that delivers [research contribution, business innovation, and social impact](./PROJECTS.md).
We act as a software factory for Generative Intelligence Systems, aiming to fast track innovation by translating research into real-world impact! We bring together expertise and [Research Resources](./PROJECTS#resources) specialized in this technology to connect solution requirements, prompts, pipelines, and models in composing the next-generation multi-disciplinary research applications.


### We are builders of Generative Intelligence Systems!

We seek to support rapid experimentation of GenAI-based multi-disciplinary research applications. We host [Research Resources](./PROJECTS#resources)  tailored to emerging use cases. From intelligent chatbots, to well-architected  multi-agent systems, and specialized models, our systems are built to serve as foundational tools for accelerating discovery, enhancing decision-making, and amplifying human creativity.

The Lab promotes [knowledge transfer](./KNOWLEDGE.md) through technical reports, scientific publications, and educational initiatives.  We actively promote [projects and use cases](./PROJECTS#use-cases) aligned with real-world needs,  with a strong focus on technology transfer, spinning out startups, and supporting the broader innovation ecosystem.

## Scope 

![GenI-Lab Expertise](./images/genilab-scope.png)

Our expertise and research interests lie in the intersection between:

* **Computational Intelligence:** building adaptive systems that learn and self-organize to handle complex, real-world challenges. This is the core of Artificial Intelligent Systems and towards Artificial Broad Intelligence (or Domain-General Intelligence).
* **Generative Intelligence Systems:** designing systems that generate meaningful actions using Prompts, Pipelines, and  Generative Models, integrated with Agents and Artifacts.
* **[Collective Intelligence](https://medium.com/generative-intelligence-lab/collective-intelligence-concepts-and-research-opportunities-6130ef044114)**: creating distributed systems that collaborate across agents to solve problems and evolve as a unified whole. These include Multi-Agent Systems and solutions for Human-Agent interaction.
