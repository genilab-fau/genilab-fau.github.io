The Generative Intelligence Lab aims to advance the research, development, and education of Generative Intelligent Systems that empower individuals and organizations to address real-world challenges and improve quality of life.

### Our focus:
* **Fundamental Research**: advance the core technologies, methodologies, and best practices in Computational Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Generative Intelligence.
* **Human-Centered Design**: create intelligent systems that produce innovative and practical solutions while remaining aligned with human values, intentions, and cultural contexts.
* **Collaborative Intelligence**: design systems that not only generate content, but also actively collaborate with humans and other agents in co-creative, interactive workflows.
* **Social Impac**t: partner with academia, industry, and the educational community to ensure our work delivers meaningful and positive outcomes for society.

### Our tools:
* [Owlmind](https://github.com/genilab-fau/owlmind): Framework for Experimentation and Education with Hybrid Artificial intelligence.
* [Prompt Engineering Lab](https://github.com/genilab-fau/prompt-eng): Education and Research with Prompt Engineering Techniques and use cases.
