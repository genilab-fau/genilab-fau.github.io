## Project Ideas

We outline ideas for projects aligned with our [Research Interests](README.md#research-interests) and applying our [Research Tools](README.md#research-tools) through a number of pages and resources:

* [Course Exercises](docs/EXERCISES.md) provides ideas for exercises and course-level projects using Generative System Technology, like Pormpt Engineering, RAG, Hybrid AI, and others
* [Community Papers Series](https://medium.com/generative-intelligence-lab/community-papers-series-ebacc91b47ea) (on Medium) presents concepts and topics that can lead to interesting explorations. Each paper provides the sections ``Research Opportunities`` and Ideas for ``Research Projects`` for the specific topic.
