## Project Ideas

We outline ideas for projects aligned with our [Research Interests](README.md#research-interests) and applying our [Research Tools](README.md#research-tools) through a number of pages and resources:

* [Community Papers Series](https://medium.com/generative-intelligence-lab/community-papers-series-ebacc91b47ea) (on Medium) presents research concepts that can lead to interesting explorations. Each paper provides sections ``Research Opportunities`` and ``Ideas for Research Projects`` listing Ph.D.-level and Master Research-level projects.
* [Course Exercises](./docs/EXERCISES.md) provides ideas for projects that can be executed as course exercises or as hobby. These exercises are rooted in Generative Intelligent System concepts, like Prompt Engineering, RAG, Agents, Hybrid AI, and others.

## Improving our Research Tools

We'd love to have your contributions to our code!

Our [Research Tools](README.md#research-tools) are community projects that aims to provide frameworks for  Education and Experimentation with Generative Intelligence System. If you are trying our tools on your projects and think there are missing features, potential enhancements, or bugs that need to be fixed, then we need your help!

### Ownmind

[Owlmind](https://github.com/genilab-fau/owlmind) is our framework for education and experimentation with Hybrid Artificial Intelligence.

To help our with this project, start with the [issue tracker](https://github.com/genilab-fau/owlmind/issues). In particular, look for entries in these categories, depending on your interests and skills:

- [good first issues](https://github.com/genilab-fau/owlmind/labels/good-first-issue)
- [enhancements](https://github.com/genilab-fau/owlmind/labels/enhancement)
- [challenges](https://github.com/genilab-fau/owlmind/labels/challenges)


### Guidelines

We use the usual GitHub pull-request flow, which may be familiar to you if you've contributed to other projects on GitHub.  For the mechanics,
see [GitHub's documentation on Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

You do not need to ask for permission to work on any of these issues. Just fix the issue yourself, using your installation, and open a pull request.

To get help ``fixing a specific issue``, it is often best to add a comment to the issue itself. You're much more likely to get help if you provide details about what you've tried and where you've looked (maintainers tend to help those who help themselves). 

The best pull requests are focused, clearly describe their purpose, and make sure
anyone fells comfortable they have been  tested and will work well. 
Some good advices compiled from different sources:

* PR contains a single logical change. Grouping multiple not directly related changes 
into a single PR makes them slower to review.
* PR has tests (if relevant). If there are no tests, we'll probably ask you to write them. 
In some cases (most notably platform compatibility), we may do manual testing instead.
* PR has clean CI builds and merges cleanly.
* PR has a message or comments that explain what the PR does in some detail, and why this 
is useful. For small changes this is less important, but the more complex the change, 
the more important this is.
* There is an open issue in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/genilab-fau/owlmind/issues) 
related to your PR that has been discussed, and there are no unresolved objections 
or open questions. 
* PRs that address issues in more imminent milestones get priority when reviewing.

Also, do not squash your commits after you have submitted a pull request, as this
erases context during review. We will squash commits when the pull request is merged.

### Code of Conduct

Everyone participating in our community projects is expected to treat other people with respect and more generally to follow the guidelines articulated in the  [Community Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/).
