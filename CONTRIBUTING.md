## Project Ideas

We outline ideas for projects aligned with our [Research Interests](README.md#research-interests) and applying our [Research Tools](README.md#research-tools) through a number of pages and resources:

* [Course Exercises](docs/EXERCISES.md) provides ideas for projects that can be executed as course exercises; these projects are rooted in Generative Intelligent System concepts, like Prompt Engineering, RAG, Agents, Hybrid AI, and others.
* [Community Papers Series](https://medium.com/generative-intelligence-lab/community-papers-series-ebacc91b47ea) (on Medium) presents research concepts that can lead to interesting explorations. Each paper provides sections ``Research Opportunities`` and ``Ideas for Research Projects`` listing Ph.D.-level and Master Research-level projects.
