The Generative Intelligence Lab is dedicated to the research-driven development of Generative Intelligence Systems that delivers [research contribution, business innovation, and social impact](./PROJECTS.md).

We support rapid experimentation with GenAI-powered, multidisciplinary research applications. Our Lab provides [Research Resources](./PROJECTS#resources)  tailored to emerging use cases. From intelligent chatbots to well-architected multi-agent systems and specialized models, our systems are built to serve as foundational tools for accelerating discovery, enhancing decision-making, and amplifying human creativity.

Our Lab continuously develops and shares [projects](./PROJECTS#use-cases) and [practical exercises](./EXERCISES.md#industry-use-cases) tied to real-world challenges. We're driven by **technology transfer, ecosystem development, and launching the next generation of startups**.

## Expertise

| | |
| - | - |
| [Our expertise](KNOWLEDGE.md) and research interests lie in the intersection between:
[**Generative Intelligence Systems:**](https://medium.com/generative-intelligence-lab/generative-intelligence-systems-concepts-and-research-opportunities-0740b1b5c7eb) design systems that generate meaningful actions using Prompts, Pipelines, and  Generative Models, eventually integrated in Multi-Agent Systems.<br/>[**Computational Intelligence:**](https://medium.com/generative-intelligence-lab/computational-intelligence-concepts-and-research-opportunities-c32d4a65eddb) build adaptive systems that learn and self-organize to handle complex, real-world challenges. This is the core of Artificial Intelligent Systems and a step toward Artificial Broad Intelligence. <br/> **[Collective Intelligence](https://medium.com/generative-intelligence-lab/collective-intelligence-concepts-and-research-opportunities-6130ef044114)**: creating distributed systems that collaborate across agents to solve problems and evolve as a unified whole. This includes Multi-Agent Systems and Human-Agent interaction solutions. | ![Scope of work of the GenI-Lab](./images/genilab-scope.png) |
