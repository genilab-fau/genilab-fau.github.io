## Publications

The Generative Intelligence Lab promotes knowledge transfer through technical reports, scientific publications, and educational activities. We support the following initiatives:

* [Publications by the Generative Intelligence Lab](https://medium.com/generative-intelligence-lab) is a venue to promote publications that communicate our research insights, practical use cases, and experimental findings. 
* [Research Community Papers](https://medium.com/generative-intelligence-lab/community-papers-series-ebacc91b47ea) explain the topics around our key research focus, providing an overview around the concepts, research challenges, and ideas for research projects. Selected topics:
    * Computational Intelligence.
    * Generative Intelligent Systems.
    * [Collective Intelligence](https://medium.com/generative-intelligence-lab/collective-intelligence-concepts-and-research-opportunities-6130ef044114).
