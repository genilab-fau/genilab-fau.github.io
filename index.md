The Generative Intelligence Lab in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at FAU supports the design, development, and deployment of research-driven [Generative Intelligence Systems](https://medium.com/generative-intelligence-lab/generative-intelligence-systems-concepts-and-research-opportunities-0740b1b5c7eb) for our research community and industry partners.

<h3 style="color:#2B65CF">We are builders of Generative Intelligence Systems!</h3>

We operate as **a Studio for Generative Intelligence Systems in Multi-Disciplinary Research Applications** using specialized toolkits to connect solution requirements, prompts, pipelines, and models. Key to our success is the **adoption of rapid prototyping processes and solutions**. 

Our lab provides [Research Resources](./projects.md#resources) tailored to emerging use cases in multidisciplinary research. We pride ourselves on being able to develop GenAI-powered systems fast and robustly. Our frameworks allow us to fast prototype solutions as:

* **Data analytic workflows** to simplify exploration, understanding, recommendation, and automated model generation for datasets in diverse fields of research. 
* **Chatbots** for personal assistants in diverse fields.
* **'Ask document' applications**, allowing natural interaction with non-structure documents. 
* **'Ask Data' applications**, providing personal assistance and automation while exploring large datasets.
* **Solutions for Multi-user Interactions**, supporting new GenAI-powered solutions in [Collective Intelligence](https://medium.com/generative-intelligence-lab/collective-intelligence-concepts-and-research-opportunities-6130ef044114). 
* .. and more.


<h3 style="color:#2B65CF">Advancing open science and the creative economy!</h3>

We champion **open science and knowledge transfer**. We frequently promote [Tutorials, Workshops, and Publications](./knowledge.md) to educate our research community and inspire new projects. We develop open projects [projects](./projects.md) and [practical exercises](./exercises.md) tied to real-world challenges. We are driven by **technology transfer, ecosystem development, and launching the next generation of startups**.
