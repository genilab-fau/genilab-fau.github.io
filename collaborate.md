## Research Collaborators

Our goal is to bring together (and support) a group curious minds exploring meaningful research and novel ideas. 

**Our strategy** is to:

* Actively foster **collaboration with research partners**, with a strong emphasis on multidisciplinary approaches.
* Design and organize **multidisciplinary research projects**.
* Promote high-quality **publications that showcase our capabilities**.
* Align our efforts with **research priorities by research-supporting organizations** (NSF, NIH, etc).
* Pursue **funding opportunities**, including grants and other forms of financial support.
  
If you are interested in research collaboration and/or have an idea for a multidisciplinary project, please reach out to [Dr. Koch](https://www.fau.edu/engineering/directory/faculty/koch/).
