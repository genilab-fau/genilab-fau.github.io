Thank you for your interest in joining the Generative Intelligence Lab at FAU!

We are builders of Generative Intelligence Systems! Our goal is to foster a  community of curious minds exploring meaningful research and novel ideas aligned with our research interests. 

You can join us in one of the following capacities:

* **[Individual Contributor](CONTRIBUTING.md)**  to our Research Resources.
* **[Postdoc Researchers](#postdoctoral-researchers)**.
* **[Ph.D. Students](#phd-students)**.
* **[Master Researcher](#master-researcher)**.
* **[Undergraduate Researcher](#undergradute-researcher)**.

### Project Ideas

We share ideas for interesting research projects within the scope of our [Research Interests](README.md#scope) through these resources:

* [Research Community Papers](https://medium.com/generative-intelligence-lab/community-papers-series-ebacc91b47ea) explain the topics around our key research focus, providing an overview around the concepts, research challenges, and ideas for research projects. 
* [Course Exercises](./EXERCISES.md) provides ideas for projects that can be executed as course exercises or as hobby. These exercises are rooted in practical concepts of Generative Intelligent System, like Prompt Engineering, RAG, Agents, Hybrid AI, and others.
