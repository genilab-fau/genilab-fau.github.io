## Projects

The Generative Intelligence Lab is a group of builders dedicated to the research-driven development of Generative Intelligence Systems. We support rapid experimentation with GenAI-powered, multidisciplinary research applications. 

We host a list of use cases that we are promoting as exercises:

* [Industry Use Cases](./EXERCISES.md): provides a list of compiled ideas related to industry use cases. These prospective projects are rooter in practical concepts of Generative Intelligent System, like Prompt 

Moreover, We are actively looking for new [Project Ideas](JOIN.md#project-ideas) from Research Collaborators and Industry Partners!  Reach out to Dr. Koch if you are willing to collaborate with us.
