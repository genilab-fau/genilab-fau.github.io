## Projects

The Generative Intelligence Lab is a group of builders dedicated to the research-driven development of Generative Intelligence Systems. We support rapid experimentation with GenAI-powered, multidisciplinary research applications.

We are actively looking for new [Project Ideas](JOINING.md#project-ideas) from Research Collaborators and Industry Partners! 
Please, reach out to Dr. Koch if you are willing to collaborate in any project.
