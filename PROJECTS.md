## Projects

The Generative Intelligence Lab is a group of builders working as a software factory for Generative Intelligence Systems in Multi-Disciplinary Research Applications and Industry Collaboration.

We favor the development of projects around **Multi-Department Collaboration** and **Industry partners**. If you have an idea for a project or [want to join as a collaborator](JOIN.md), please, reach out Dr. Koch. 

If you want to collaborate and looking for a project, we publish our **Ideas for Projects** through:

* [**Use Case Compendium**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ge2chxRrBjILHkZthtzymqAbs3TkwrGiMMge23zC8jA/edit?usp=sharing): a curate, open-science list of industry use cases compiled from exchanges with experts, industry demands, and diverse publications.

* [**Research Community Papers**](https://medium.com/generative-intelligence-lab/community-papers-series-ebacc91b47ea): explain concepts around our key research focus, providing an overview around the concepts, research challenges.

* [**Exercises**](./EXERCISES.md): open-science exercises for hobbyists and coursework.


## Resources

Our research toolkits are designed to support rapid experimentation and knowledge sharing.
