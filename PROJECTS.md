## Projects

The Generative Intelligence Lab is a group of builders dedicated to the research-driven development of Generative Intelligence Systems. We support rapid experimentation with GenAI-powered, multidisciplinary research applications. 

We publish our **Ideas for Projects** through:

* [**Use Case Compendium**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ge2chxRrBjILHkZthtzymqAbs3TkwrGiMMge23zC8jA/edit?usp=sharing): a curate, open-science list of industry use cases compiled from exchanges with experts, industry demands, and diverse publications.

* [**Research Community Papers**](https://medium.com/generative-intelligence-lab/community-papers-series-ebacc91b47ea): explain concepts around our key research focus, providing an overview around the concepts, research challenges.

* [**Exercises**](./EXERCISES.md): open-science exercises for hobbyists and coursework.


## Resources

Our research toolkits are designed to support rapid experimentation and knowledge sharing.
