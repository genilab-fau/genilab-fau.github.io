## Exercises

Welcome to the Exercises section!
These exercises are designed to complement our [Courses, Tutorials, and Workshops](./knowledge.md) providing a structured and progressive framework for learning how to build a variety of [Generative Intelligence Systems](https://medium.com/generative-intelligence-lab/generative-intelligence-systems-concepts-and-research-opportunities-0740b1b5c7eb).

The learning path is hands-on and application-focused. You’ll begin by constructing simple, automated interactions. From there, you’ll evolve your systems into document-based Q&A applications, transition into agent-driven workflows, and eventually orchestrate multi-agent solutions that support rich human-AI collaboration.

As you move through the exercises, you will explore a wide array of foundational and advanced topics, such as prompt engineering, workflow pipelines, model integration, memory systems, and intelligent agents. Along the way, you’ll encounter ideas like artifact generation, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), hybrid intelligence, and collaborative AI frameworks.

While you are welcome to integrate commercial model providers such as OpenAI or Gemini, you're equally empowered to use local models through [Ollama](http://www.ollama.com) and our internal solutions without requiring external subscriptions.


WORK IN PROGRESS.
