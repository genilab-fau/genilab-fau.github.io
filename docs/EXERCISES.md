## Course Exercises

These exercises are designed to mirror real-world business scenarios and challenges, showcasing how Generative Intelligence Systems are being applied across various industries. The tasks will help you build practical skills by engaging with solutions rooted in industry frameworks and best practices.

What to Expect:
* Hands-on problem-solving using Generative Intelligence Systems.
* Frameworks build upon our [Research Tools](README.md#research-tools)
* Business use cases across different sectors.
* Opportunities to customize and expand for your problem scenario and solution design.


### How to Approach Each Exercise

We recommend to apply the Software Development Life Cycle approach to structure your problem-solving process. Generative AI can be applied throughout the process with diffrent degrees of effectiveness. In fact, the very process of applying GenAI techniques for SDLC is a good experiment by itself!

* **Problem Identification:** Understand the core issue for your use case. Clearly define the ``problem statement``! This includes identifying pain points, inefficiencies, or unmet needs within a specific process or industry context. Questions:
   * What is the business challenge or user need?
   * Who are the stakeholders involved?
   * Why does this problem matter?
* **Solution Ideation:** Explore potential ways to solve the problem. he goal here isnâ€™t to settle on a perfect solution immediately, but to generate possibilities and consider which directions are most promising. Questions:
   * What are possible solutions?
   * Can Generative AI offer an innovative approach?
   * Are there existing frameworks or models to build from?
