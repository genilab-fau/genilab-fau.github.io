## Course Exercises

These exercises are designed to mirror real-world business scenarios and challenges, showcasing how Generative Intelligence Systems are being applied across various industries. Each task will help you build practical skills by engaging with solutions rooted in industry frameworks and best practices.

What to Expect:
* Hands-on problem-solving using Generative Intelligence Systems.
* Frameworks build upon our [Research Tools](README.md#research-tools)
* Business use cases across different sectors.
* Opportunities to customize and expand for your problem scenario and solution design.


### How to Approach Each Exercise

We recommend to apply the Software Development Life Cycle approach (see Diagram 1) to structure your problem-solving process through your exercise. Generative AI an be applied throughout the process and thinking about the right Prompt Engineering process for each phase could be an exercise by itself.

* **Problem Identification:** Understand the core issue for your use case. Begin by clearly defining the problem youâ€™re trying to solve or the business opportunity you're addressing. This includes identifying pain points, inefficiencies, or unmet needs within a specific process or industry context. Ask:
  *  What is the business challenge or user need?
  * Who are the stakeholders involved?
  * Why does this problem matter?
* **Solution Design:** Conceptualize a framework or approach

Once the problem is understood, design a high-level approach to solve it. This includes drafting how Generative AI can be utilized within an existing framework or creating a new one. Think creatively but practically. Ask:

What kind of solution would address this challenge?
How can AI augment or automate part of the process?
What ethical or compliance considerations apply?
