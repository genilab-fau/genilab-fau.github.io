## Operation

![GenI-Lab Activities](./images/genilab-activities.png)


The Generative Intelligence Lab is a group of builders working as a software factory for Generative Intelligence Systems in Multi-Disciplinary Research Applications and Industry Collaboration.

**We favor the development of projects around Multi-Disciplinary Collaboration** and with **Industry Partners**. If you have an idea for a project or [want to join as a collaborator](join.md), reach out to [Dr. Koch](https://www.fau.edu/engineering/directory/faculty/koch/). 


## Project Ideas

We publish our **Ideas for Projects** through:

* [**Use Case Compendium**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ge2chxRrBjILHkZthtzymqAbs3TkwrGiMMge23zC8jA/edit?usp=sharing): a curate, open-science list of industry use cases compiled from exchanges with experts, industry demands, and diverse publications.

* [**Research Community Papers**](https://medium.com/generative-intelligence-lab/community-papers-series-ebacc91b47ea): explain concepts around our key research focus, providing an overview around the concepts, research challenges.

* [**Exercises**](./exercises.md): open-science exercises for hobbyists and coursework.


## Resources

Our research toolkits are designed to support rapid experimentation and knowledge sharing.
